# AI Health Diagnosis System

## Introduction

AI Health Diagnosis System is an open-source project that uses artificial intelligence to detect if a person is at risk of diabetes or heart disease. The system leverages machine learning models built with `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to analyze medical data and provide accurate health predictions. This software aims to be a new alternative to traditional medical consultations by offering a quick, data-driven diagnosis.

## Features

- Detects risk for diabetes and heart disease using AI models.
- Utilizes well-known machine learning libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
- User-friendly interface.
- Available on Linux and Windows.
- Open-source, allowing developers to contribute and improve the system.

## Requirements

Before installing and running the system, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pandas` library
- `scikit-learn` library
- Linux or Windows operating system

You can install the required dependencies using:
